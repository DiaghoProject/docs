# Diagho Architecture

The architecture of the __Diagho application__ is based on microservices running with _Docker_ and _Docker Compose_.

A [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/DiaghoProject/diagho-hugo-prod/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file is available in the project repository to provide a ready-to-use environment for demo.
